Variance
--
A statistical measure of the dispersion of a set of values often used in machine learning to understand data distribution

$$
\frac{1}{N} \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \bar{x}) ^ 2
$$

**With**:
- $x_i$ be each value in the data set
- $\bar{x}$ be the mean of all values in the data set
- N be the number of values in the data set

Unsupervised Learning
--

A type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from unlabeled data often used for clustering or anomaly detection.

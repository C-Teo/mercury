Variance
--
A statistical measure of the dispersion of a set of values often used in machine learning to understand data distribution

$$
\frac{1}{N} \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \bar{x}) ^ 2
$$

**With**:
- $x_i$ be each value in the data set
- $\bar{x}$ be the mean of all values in the data set
- N be the number of values in the data set

Unsupervised Learning
--

Unsupervised learning in artificial intelligence is a type of machine learning that learns from data without human supervision. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised machine learning models are given unlabeled data and allowed to discover patterns and insights without any explicit guidance or instruction.

_Example: Clustering_

--

Applying knowledge from one task to a different but related task, often used to improve model performance

Gradient Descent
--

Optimization algorithm used to find the local minimum of a fuction by iteratively adjusting its parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
--

Variant of gradient descent that updates the models parameters using only a single data point at each iteration

Sentinment Analysis
--

Use of natural language processing to identify and categorize opinions expressed in text

Regression
--

Statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables

Regularization
--

Technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function

Logistic Regression
--

Statistical method used for binary classification problems modelling the probability of a particular class
